# FooCoding Express Homework

The objective of this homework assignment is to reinforce your understanding of building a RESTful API using Express, and practicing basic file system operations in Node.js. You will be creating a simple Todos API that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todos stored in the file system.

Requirements:

- Use Express.js to create a RESTful API for managing Todos.

- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Todos.

- Store the Todos data in the file system using Node.js file system module (fs).

- Organize your code in a structured manner, separating concerns where appropriate (e.g., routes, controllers, models).

- Ensure error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid requests, missing data, etc (extra points for implementing a validation middleware with some validation library like [TypeBox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinclair/typebox), [Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi), or [Zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod)).

- Include appropriate comments to explain the functionality of each part of your code.

- Implement basic validation to ensure that data passed to the API endpoints meets expected formats.

- Add appropriate status codes and error messages in your API responses.

## Create a README.md file that includes:

- Instructions on how to run the application.

- API endpoints documentation (e.g., endpoint URLs, request methods, request and response formats).

- Any additional notes or considerations for running or testing the application.

- Test your API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl to ensure they work as expected.
